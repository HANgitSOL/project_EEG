# Introduction about EEG data processing in Python

In this week, we will learn about **preprocessing** EEG signal in Python, together.<br>
<br>
This introduction incorporates _composing_ linux environment for forward progress, _loading_ and _pre-processing_ EEG signal in Python, and _decoding_ EEG signal in Python using MVPA(multi-variate pattern analysis).<br>
For next week, we'll just look at the decoding session shallowly.<br>
<br>
There are specific examples about applications of functions and explanation anout that function.<br>
In the explanation about function, some elements are mentioned specifically, i.e. the type of variable, the meaning of variable, etc. .<br>
If you need more explanation about function, check the internet site mentioned in the _memo_ of that page.<br>
